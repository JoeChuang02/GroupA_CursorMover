# Cursor-Mover

## Project Description

We aim to develop a robust voice command recognition system, capable of understanding and responding to specific spoken instructions.  
Our application aims to enable handicapped people to control the computer through AI-assisted mouse control.

## Motivation
In an era marked by relentless scientific and technological advancement, there is an inherent belief in the need for more accessible innovations to serve the public. These innovations aim to address the limitations imposed by either congenital or acquired conditions, striving to perfect human society by doing things that human beings cannot do on their own.
After thinking about the difficulties that may be encountered in various daily lives, our group chose the target group as people who face the daily challenge of limited limb mobility. Then, combining what we have learned in the class and considering the feasibility, we will focus on our goal of developing a powerful voice command recognition system that can understand and operate the mouse in response to specific verbal commands, which means that users can control the computer verbally without touching the mouse.

## Research Method
1. Data collection
Audio clips are essential for training a voice recognition system. We collect the audio files for this model and save them on the device where we want to train the model. Below are the details of how we collect data.
 - Recording Audio Clips
To ensure the diversity of audio files, we collected data by asking people with different accents to help record the clips. By doing so, we can increase the stability in accuracy rate when under different accents and tones. We gathered 415 clips for each word, namely, 2075 files in total. All the files were stored in WAV form.
 - Labeling 
After the collection process, the files are categorized into corresponding classes: up, down, left, right and click. In each folder, clips are labeled with serial numbers (1 to 415.)
2. Coding
  - Installing and Importing Necessary Libraries
Due to the space constraint, only some special and important libraries, training processes and problem-solving methods used in the project are listed and explained below. For the complete coding, please refer to the attachment at the end of this document.
    - Installing Libraries
pydub
      - “pydub,” a Python library for audio manipulation, is needed to integrate audio processing capabilities into Python projects. It allows the performance of a variety of audio processing tasks such as cutting, concatenating, and converting audio files.
FFmpeg
      - “FFmpeg” is required by many audio and video processing libraries, including “pydub”, because it provides the necessary backend functionalities to decode, encode, and manipulate multimedia files. 
    - Importing Modules
      - train_test_split (from sklearn.model_selection)
To split datasets into training and testing subsets.
      - AudioSegment (from pydub)
The module enables loading audio files in multiple formats like WAV, MP4, W4A, etc.
  - Data Preprocess
    - MFCC
The audio files mentioned in the first bullet point were put into five categories; namely, 'up,' 'down,' ‘left,’ ‘right’ and ‘click.’ MFCC is implemented to extract data features in different classes and prepare the data for the machine learning model.
  - Model Training
    - Building CNN Model
      - Data Splitting
        The data was split into 20% training data and 80% testing data.
      - Data Scaling
        Features of audio clips that fall in the same category were first standardized by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. “x_train” was scaled after being reshaped into a 2D array. After the procedure, they were reshaped back into 4D.
    - Defining CNN Model 
Below are the chronological layers we insert into the model.
      - First Conv2D Layer with relu activator
      - First MaxPooling2D Layer with relu activator
      - Second Conv2D Layer with relu activator
      - Second MaxPooling2D Layer with relu activator
      - Flatten Layer
To flatten the 3D output to 1D.
Dense Layers with relu activator
      - Dropout Layer (set at 0.5)
To prevent overfitting. (More the solution to overfitting will be discussed in the “Training Process” section below.)
      - Dense Layers with softmax activator
Softmax activation in the final layer produces output probabilities for each class.
    - Compiling the Model
The elements we utilize to compile the model and some brief explanations or introductions are as below.
      - Optimizer: adam. An adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm.
      - Loss: sparse_categorical_crossentropy. To Classify tasks with integer labels.
      - Metrics: accuracy. To evaluate the model's performance.
    - Training Process
      - Early Stopping
An early stop mechanism with the monitor of value loss was added to the training process after encountering overfitting. Overfitting refer to the situation when the model gave too accurate predictions for training data, but not for new data. To ensure the desirable performance of the model for actual application, a  dropout layer is added (more data were also collected to alleviate the condition).
      - Model Fit
After numerous attempts, a more preferable setting came out to be epochs=20; batch size=64; validation split=0.3 (30% of the training data will be set aside as the validation set, and the model will train on the remaining 70% of the data.)
  - Cursor Control
After training the model to distinguish between the five classes, we combine it with the cursor positioning Python module, PyAutoGui to use voice commands to control the mouse. 
Locations on the screen are referred to by X and Y Cartesian coordinates. The X coordinate starts at 0 on the left side and increases going right, while the Y coordinate starts at 0 on the top and increases going down (a reverse way as mathematic). 
    - Cursor Movement
After setting the screen resolution size, (2560, 1440) the moving distance each time is 400 pixels. 
    - Voice Command Reception
The period between each voice reception is 1 second. If nothing is spoken during the duration of the model recognizes the sound recorded as words other than the five, the model will return an error and no action will be taken.

## Results
The following confusion matrix displays the results of our model's predictions compared to the actual classes. It indicates that our model is better at distinguishing "up," "down," and "click" commands, but has more difficulty distinguishing between "left" and "right."

In our final implementation, we have achieved real-time voice detection to seamlessly execute five commands. Our system operates continuously, even without internet connectivity.
